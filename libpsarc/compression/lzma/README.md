This folder contains a stripped version of the LZMA SDK version 23.01 as found on https://7-zip.org/sdk.html.

The LZMA SDK is placed in the public domain. Hence we put the code directly into this repository so that we can directly include all LZMA functionalities into our binary without any dependencies in the form of external libraries.

The C version of the LZMA SDK is used for simplicity.
